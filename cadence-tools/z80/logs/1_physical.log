**WARN: (IMPEXT-3493):	The design extraction status has been reset by the 'setExtractRCMode' command. The parasitic data can be regenerated either by extracting the design using the extractRC command or by loading the SPEF or RCDB file(s). To prevent resetting of the extraction status, avoid changing extraction modes.

Extraction called for design 'z80_top_direct_n' of instances=2805 and nets=2499 using extraction engine 'preRoute' .
**WARN: (IMPEXT-3530):	The process node is not set. Use the command setDesignMode -process <process node> prior to extraction for maximum accuracy and optimal automatic threshold setting.

PreRoute RC Extraction called for design z80_top_direct_n.
RC Extraction called in multi-corner(1) mode.
**WARN: (IMPEXT-6197):	The Cap table file is not specified. This will result in lower parasitic accuracy when using preRoute extraction or postRoute extraction with effort level 'low'. It is recommended to generate the Cap table file using the 'generateCapTbl' command and specify it before extraction using 'create_rc_corner/update_rc_corner -cap_table'.

**WARN: (TA-146):	A combinational timing loop(s) was found in the design. You can find detailed information about all timing loops in the file './CTE_loops.rpt'. You should examine loop break points chosen automatically by the tool to ensure they are the most appropriate break locations. It is further recommended that validated loop break points be added to the constraint set via set_disable_timing to ensure consistent handling during the design flow.

Extraction called for design 'z80_top_direct_n' of instances=2805 and nets=2499 using extraction engine 'postRoute' at effort level 'low' .
**WARN: (IMPEXT-3530):	The process node is not set. Use the command setDesignMode -process <process node> prior to extraction for maximum accuracy and optimal automatic threshold setting.
Type 'man IMPEXT-3530' for more detail.
PostRoute (effortLevel low) RC Extraction called for design z80_top_direct_n.
RC Extraction called in multi-corner(1) mode.
**WARN: (IMPEXT-6197):	The Cap table file is not specified. This will result in lower parasitic accuracy when using preRoute extraction or postRoute extraction with effort level 'low'. It is recommended to generate the Cap table file using the 'generateCapTbl' command and specify it before extraction using 'create_rc_corner/update_rc_corner -cap_table'.
Type 'man IMPEXT-6197' for more detail.
**WARN: (IMPEXT-3032):	Because the cap table file was not provided, it will be created internally with the following process info:
