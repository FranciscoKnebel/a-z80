      Updating RC parasitics by calling: "extract_rc -noRouteCheck"... Extraction called for design 'z80_topzera' of instances=2853 and nets=2747 using extraction engine 'preRoute' .
**WARN: (IMPEXT-3530):	The process node is not set. Use the command setDesignMode -process <process node> prior to extraction for maximum accuracy and optimal automatic threshold setting.

PreRoute RC Extraction called for design z80_topzera.
RC Extraction called in multi-corner(1) mode.
**WARN: (IMPEXT-6197):	The Cap table file is not specified. This will result in lower parasitic accuracy when using preRoute extraction or postRoute extraction with effort level 'low'. It is recommended to generate the Cap table file using the 'generateCapTbl' command and specify it before extraction using 'create_rc_corner/update_rc_corner -cap_table'.

**WARN: (TA-146):	A combinational timing loop(s) was found in the design. You can find detailed information about all timing loops in the file './CTE_loops.rpt'. You should examine loop break points chosen automatically by the tool to ensure they are the most appropriate break locations. It is further recommended that validated loop break points be added to the constraint set via set_disable_timing to ensure consistent handling during the design flow.

With the current settings, the SDF file generated will contain the same delay information for all of these arcs.
